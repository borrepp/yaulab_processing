  XYComments: "Eye data was collected with a high speed resolution IR camera and processed using C++ custom code
    developed by Jian Chen & Jing Lin at Baylor College of Medicine. Eye calibration is performed every day"
  PupilDiameterComments: "Pupil data was collected with a high speed resolution IR camera and processed using C++ custom code
    developed by Jian Chen & Jing Lin at Baylor College of Medicine. Eye calibration is performed every day and the diameter depends
    on the pupil adjustment that is performed manually (usually set to the same value for each monkey)
    Pupil diameter might not be comparable across different days"
